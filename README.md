The Find A Friend web app is hosted at: https://find-a-friend-hackmit.web.app/.

## Description

One of the biggest challenges for students as we navigate through these difficult times is finding and maintaining a sense of community despite the lack of face-to-face contact: it is close to impossible to strike up a conversation with a stranger online as one might do in person. Students have turned to anonymous confessions pages, which have seen a massive rise in popularity of late, to voice their pains and struggles; but such pages are very limited in scope and do not create lasting connections.

Our platform aims to solve this problem by allowing users to chat anonymously with a complete stranger (chosen randomly from among those registered from your school), whether to vent, rant, or simply talk. If you hit it off (and if both participants choose to reveal themselves), you will be notified of the identity of the person you were talking to, along with their contact information to continue the conversation!
